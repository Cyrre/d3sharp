The Presence service handles client subscriptions to objects and interfaces client's requests to change the
data for an object that it has previously been subscribed to.

After a *client* has mapped an object which it wants to subscribe to, it will call Subscribe(). The object
will then make notifications to the client whenever something changes server-side. The client will likewise
call Update() when it wants to change fields on an object that it has subscribed to.

If the field operation sent to Update() contains no value, the update request can be discarded (because it
doesn't actually change anything, we don't need to do anything).

If the client makes an object creation request it will not try to subscribe to it, since the creation itself
subscribes the client to the object. Note that this is not true in the case of account or toon creation --
because of the handing off that must be done the client has to ask for subscriptions to both after logon and
selection.

== Player status example ==

When a Channel has been properly mapped and subscribed to, the client will make three Update() calls when the
player changes his away status. The request, in order, will be (see notification-data-layout.txt):

** This is incorrect! Need to understand why it sends us the D3.4.1 field in the first place, then adapt to
what it means for the multi-channel model. It is unlikely that the first call sets a channel to modify/notify
on, but that is the only explanation I can come up with at this time. **

* D3.4.1 - Channel ID (should contain no value after first call, since the client isn't switching channels)
* D3.4.2 - Away status
* D3.4.3 - Away message (currently always null -- there is no way to set it in the client)

These should be re-routed to the object so that it can change the values on itself and broadcast the
notification to all (all other?) subscribers.
